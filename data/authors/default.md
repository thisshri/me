Hi there!

I am a software engineer with a passion for solving problems. With extensive experience in both front-end and back-end development, I have honed my skills in various technologies including React, Node.js, and Django.

Currently, I work at Str8bat, a sports tech company, where I primarily focus on back-end development. My role requires me to bring new and creative ideas to the table and to help bring them to life through code.

Aside from my work in the tech industry, I have a love for life and an insatiable thirst for learning. I am a people person who enjoys making others laugh through my poor jokes and puns.

In my free time, I am striving to develop a deeper connection with myself through solitude and introspection. I believe in constantly growing and improving, both professionally and personally. That is why I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
