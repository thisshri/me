# 1. Code is Difficult

You need to understand the code is

# 2. Pay attention to detail

be it a git commit message or semicolon at the end of a javascript statement pay attention to these things.
don't underestimate any line of code, don't assume things, make sure you understand what you are doing, it's important while debugging things.
Read code don't assume anything.

# 3. Test you code

Don't forget to sanity test your code and test for edge cases

# 4. Understand the flow

code is logical, there a flow, follow the flow

# Need to lean basis

# Create your value

# Don't get attached to any technology

People around you matter
cutaway from negative people, try to find someone who is as passionate as you and spend time talking to them about things you want to understand and learn

# Git blame

don't write or copy-paste/ use code which you don't understand, you have the total responsibility of the code by your commit. don't have any doubts about the code you write, this is an opportunity to learn.

# Become a good developer by 

writing a lot of code creating something on you own, any side project and get confidence. there is no alternative of writing code.
more you do better you get.

# Create a plan for what you want to achieve don't wander around.

write code break things rather than writing and completing things n your head.
don't freak out by the complexity of the task, have a plan, write code, and break it fix it.
take some time and figure out all the ways the problem can be fixed.
write the complete thought, how you would tackle
figure out the best way, what you are doing should be clear

# Be calm and composed

a good developer is one who is calm and composed in the time of crisis
